# Internal Competitions

Put your child's skills to the test against other Foundation Tennis players. Our internal competitions provide real match experience in a friendly, supportive environment.

## Why Competition Matters

Match play teaches things that lessons cannot. Your child learns to handle pressure, manage nerves, and compete fairly. They experience winning and losing, and grow from both.

Our internal comps are designed to be fun first. Players compete, but the atmosphere stays positive and encouraging.

## Red Ball Competition

For beginner players using red balls on small courts.

### Schedule

- **Saturdays:** 11am-12pm
- **Fridays:** 4:15-5:15pm

### Pricing

- **Full term (8 weeks):** $50
- **Casual entry:** $10 per session

Casual entry is perfect if you want to try competition before committing or if your schedule varies week to week.

### What to Expect

Players rotate through matches against different opponents. Games are short and fast, keeping everyone engaged. Coaches supervise and help with scoring and rules.

## Transition Competition (Orange/Green)

For developing players using orange or green balls on larger courts.

### Schedule

- **Saturdays:** 11am-12:15pm (includes Friday 4:15-5:15pm session)

### Pricing

- **Full term:** $110
- **Fridays only:** $50
- **No casual option available**

The term commitment ensures consistent player numbers each week, making for better matches.

### What to Expect

Longer matches on bigger courts. Players develop tactical awareness as rallies get longer and games become more strategic. This competition bridges the gap between training and tournament play.

## Benefits of Internal Comps

**Match experience without pressure.** Your child plays real matches against familiar faces in a supportive setting.

**Skill application.** What they learn in lessons gets tested in competition.

**Social connection.** Players bond through friendly competition. Rivalries form, friendships deepen.

**Tournament preparation.** Internal comps prepare players for Tennis Australia junior tournaments when they are ready.

## Who Should Join?

**Red Ball Comp:** Any player currently in Red Group or higher who wants to try match play.

**Transition Comp:** Players in Orange or Green Group who are ready for structured competition.

Unsure if your child is ready? Ask their coach. We are happy to advise.
