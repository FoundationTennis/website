# Blue Group Tennis

Your child takes their very first steps in tennis with our Blue Group. Using soft foam balls and fun games, 5-6 year olds develop coordination while discovering the joy of hitting a ball.

## What Makes Blue Group Special

Blue Group is designed for the youngest beginners. Everything is scaled to match their age - smaller rackets, softer balls, and shorter games. The focus is on movement, fun, and building confidence.

Your child will not just learn tennis skills. They will develop coordination, listening skills, and the ability to follow instructions in a group setting.

## What Your Child Will Learn

- Basic racket handling and ball control
- Hand-eye coordination through games
- Simple forehand and backhand movements
- Moving around the court with purpose
- Following instructions and taking turns
- Love for tennis through play
