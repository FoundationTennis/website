# Green Group Tennis

Your child steps onto the full court for the first time. Green Group uses a slightly slower ball that gives players time to develop proper technique while playing real tennis on real courts.

## What Makes Green Group Special

Green ball is the final step before yellow (standard) tennis. Your child experiences full court dimensions, proper serving distances, and complete match play.

The ball is just 25% slower than standard, meaning technique developed here transfers directly to yellow ball tennis. This is where players become tennis players.

## What Your Child Will Learn

- Full court groundstroke technique
- Complete serve development
- Net play and volleying
- Court movement and positioning
- Tactical game planning
- Match play and scoring
