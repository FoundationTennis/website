# Red Group Tennis

Your child builds real tennis foundations in our Red Group. Using softer balls on smaller courts, players aged 5-8 develop technique through games and activities designed for their size and ability.

## What Makes Red Group Special

Red ball tennis is where proper technique begins. The ball bounces lower and slower, giving young players time to set up and swing correctly. The smaller court means less running and more rallying.

Your child will experience real tennis - serving, rallying, and scoring - scaled to make success achievable.

## What Your Child Will Learn

- Forehand and backhand groundstrokes
- Basic serving technique
- Movement and footwork fundamentals
- Simple rally patterns
- Understanding of basic scoring
- Teamwork and sportsmanship
