# Orange Group Tennis

Your child takes the next step in their tennis development. Orange Group uses three-quarter courts and a ball that moves faster than red, building real tennis skills while keeping success within reach.

## What Makes Orange Group Special

Orange ball bridges the gap between beginner and full tennis. The court is larger, the ball is faster, but your child is ready for the challenge.

Players develop proper technique that will carry through to full court tennis. Rallies get longer, tactics start to matter, and match play becomes more strategic.

## What Your Child Will Learn

- Refined groundstroke technique
- Volleys and net play basics
- Improved serving mechanics
- Movement patterns across the court
- Basic tactical awareness
- Match play experience
