# Development Package

For players ready to take their tennis seriously. The Development Package combines weekly group training with squad sessions, analysis, and tournament support in one complete program.

## What Makes This Package Special

This is not just more tennis. It is smarter tennis. Your child receives structured development with clear goals, expert feedback, and a pathway to competitive play.

Players in this program train together, compete together, and grow together. They become part of a squad that pushes each other to improve.

## What is Included

### Weekly Group Training (2 Sessions)

Choose any two group lessons per week at your child's level. Consistent group training builds technique, fitness, and match experience.

### Thursday Development Squads

Intensive squad training focused on skill development:

- **Red Squad:** 4-4:45pm
- **Orange Squad:** 4:45-5:30pm
- **Green Squad:** 5:30-6:15pm
- **Yellow Squad:** 6:15-7:15pm
- **Elite Squad:** 7:15-8:30pm

Squads are smaller than regular groups, allowing more individual attention.

### Morning Squads

Early morning training for dedicated players:

- **Tuesday:** 7-8am (On-court training)
- **Wednesday:** 7-8am (Fitness session at QT)
- **Thursday:** 7-8am (On-court training)

Morning sessions build fitness, mental toughness, and commitment.

### Video Analysis

Regular video analysis of your child's technique. See exactly what is happening in their strokes and understand how to improve.

### Match Analysis

When your child plays matches, we break down what happened. What worked, what did not, and what to focus on next.

### Progress Reports

Written feedback on your child's development. Know where they are progressing and what they are working on.

### Tournament Support

Guidance for entering tournaments, preparation advice, and support at events when possible.

## Pricing

**$500 per 8-week term**

This includes everything listed above. No hidden costs, no extra fees for squads or analysis.

### What This Replaces

If you bought these components separately:
- Two groups: $240-$300/term
- Additional squad access: not available separately
- Video analysis: included
- Match analysis: included
- Progress reports: included

The Development Package gives you everything in one simple price.

## Who Is This For?

The Development Package is right for players who:

- Train at least twice per week already
- Show commitment and enthusiasm for improvement
- Are interested in competitive play or tournaments
- Want structured development with clear goals
- Can attend Thursday squads and some morning sessions

If your child is still finding their love for tennis or prefers casual training, group lessons might be a better fit.
