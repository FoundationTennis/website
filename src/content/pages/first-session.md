# What to Expect at Your First Lesson

Starting something new can feel uncertain. Here is everything you need to know so your child arrives ready to play.

## What to Bring

**Tennis racket**
Bring your child's racket if they have one. If not, we have rackets available to borrow at no charge.

**Water bottle**
Active kids need to stay hydrated, especially in warmer weather.

**Sunscreen and hat**
We play outdoors. In summer, please apply sunscreen before arriving and bring a hat.

## What to Wear

Comfortable clothes your child can move in. Sports shoes are essential - no sandals or open-toed shoes.

Tennis-specific clothing is not required. Shorts, t-shirts, and sports attire all work well.

## Arrival Time

Please arrive at least 5 minutes before the lesson starts. This gives your child time to:

- Meet their coach
- Get comfortable with the environment
- Warm up with the group

## For Parents

Feel free to watch from the viewing area. We ask that parents stay off the court during lessons. This helps kids focus and allows coaches to run sessions smoothly.

You are welcome to stay for the full lesson or return at pick-up time. Either way, please be on time for collection.

## The Trial Session

Your child will join an existing group at their level. There is no separate "trial session" - they simply participate in a regular lesson.

This gives you a true sense of what weekly lessons look like. Your child will meet other players, experience our coaching style, and have fun.

After the trial, we will chat about whether the group is the right fit. If not, we will suggest alternatives.

## What Happens During a Lesson

Every lesson includes:

- **Warm-up games:** Get moving and engaged
- **Skill development:** Technical focus appropriate to their level
- **Fun activities:** Games that reinforce learning
- **Match play:** Age-appropriate competition

Our coaches create an energetic, supportive environment. Kids learn best when they are having fun.

## After the Lesson

If your child enjoyed the session and wants to continue, we will help you sign up for the term. We can discuss:

- Which group fits best
- Available time slots
- Payment options and discounts

There is no pressure. Take time to decide what works for your family.
