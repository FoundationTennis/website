# Tennis Programs for Every Age and Stage

Foundation Tennis offers programs designed around how kids actually learn. From first-time players to competitive juniors, your child will find the right fit here.

## How Our Programs Work

All group programs run in 8-week terms, matching the school calendar. This gives your child time to build skills and friendships with the same group each week.

### Ball Colours Explained

Tennis Australia's progressive ball system helps kids develop proper technique on appropriately-sized courts:

- **Blue Ball:** Foam ball for beginners (ages 5-6)
- **Red Ball:** 75% slower, small court (ages 5-8)
- **Orange Ball:** 50% slower, 3/4 court (ages 8-10)
- **Green Ball:** 25% slower, full court (ages 9-12)
- **Yellow Ball:** Standard ball, full court (ages 10+)
