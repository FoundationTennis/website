# Frequently Asked Questions

Find answers to the most common questions about Foundation Tennis. If your question is not here, contact us directly.

## Getting Started

### How do I book a trial lesson?

Contact us by phone (0431 368 752) or email (foundationtennis@hotmail.com) with your child's name, age, and any tennis experience. We will find a suitable group and book you in.

### What age can my child start?

We accept players from age 5. Our Blue Group is designed specifically for 5-6 year olds new to tennis.

### Does my child need their own racket?

Not for the trial. We have rackets available to borrow. If your child continues, we can advise on the right racket size to purchase.

### What should my child wear to their first lesson?

Comfortable sports clothing and proper sports shoes. No sandals or open-toed shoes. In summer, apply sunscreen and bring a hat.

## Programs and Groups

### How do I know which group is right for my child?

Start with a trial. Our coaches will assess your child's age, experience, and skill level to recommend the best fit.

### Can my child attend more than one group per week?

Yes. Many players attend two groups weekly. We offer discounted rates for multi-group enrolment - $240/term for two 45-minute groups or $300/term for two 60-minute groups.

### What is the Development Package?

Our most comprehensive program at $500/term. It includes two weekly groups, Thursday development squad, morning squad access, video analysis, match analysis, progress reports, and tournament support.

### What if we cannot attend every week of the term?

Let us know about planned absences. We try to arrange make-up lessons where possible, though this is not always guaranteed.

## Pricing and Payment

### What are your prices?

- Blue Group (30 min): $120/term
- 45-minute groups: $160/term
- 60-minute groups: $200/term
- Development Package: $500/term

All terms run for 8 weeks.

### Do you offer discounts?

**Early Bird:** 10% off when you sign up and pay before the term deadline.

**Sports Voucher:** $100 discount with government sports voucher. Use code "VOUCHER" at checkout.

**Multi-Group:** Save when enrolling in two groups per week.

### Do you offer payment plans?

Yes. We offer flexible payment options for families who need them. Contact us to discuss.

### Can I use the government sports voucher?

Absolutely. Apply your $100 sports voucher by using code "VOUCHER" during checkout. We handle the voucher claim process after that.

## Private Lessons

### Do you offer private lessons?

Yes. Private lessons are available with:
- Maxim: $50/30min (limited availability, development players only)
- Zoe: $40/30min
- Sota/George: $30/30min

### Who should consider private lessons?

Private lessons work best for players transitioning to tournament play or wanting focused technical development. For beginners, group lessons are usually a better starting point.

## Policies

### What is your cancellation policy?

Please notify us of any absences in advance. We appreciate at least 24 hours notice where possible.

### What happens if it rains?

If weather forces a lesson cancellation, we will offer a make-up session or credit towards the next term.

### Do you run during school holidays?

Regular term programs follow the school calendar. We occasionally run holiday programs - check our announcements for details.
