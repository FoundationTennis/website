# About Foundation Tennis

Foundation Tennis helps kids discover tennis in a way that stays with them for life. We combine proven coaching methods with a community feel that makes every player feel welcome.

## Our Story

Foundation Tennis began in 2009, started by former ATP coach Jack Reader alongside his son Mike and students Nick, Miguel, and Josh. What started as a shared passion for tennis grew into something special.

Maxim joined the team in 2015, bringing fresh energy and ideas. Over time, the business evolved, and today Maxim runs Foundation Tennis solo. The mission remains the same: help kids fall in love with tennis.

## Our Home at Somerton Park

We moved to Somerton Park Tennis Club back in 2012, and it was the right fit from day one. The club has a cozy, welcoming feel. Being close to the beach adds to the relaxed atmosphere.

SPTC gives our players a real tennis club experience. They feel part of something bigger than just lessons. The courts, the community, the location - it all works together.

## Our Philosophy

Tennis is more than hitting a ball. Every shot connects to something deeper.

We help kids understand themselves and their tennis through feel and problem-solving. When something goes right or wrong on court, we ask: why did that happen?

Technical, physical, emotional, mental - it all combines to produce each result. Our coaching addresses the whole player, not just their forehand.

### What We Believe

**Growth matters more than winning.** Every player improves at their own pace. We celebrate progress, not just trophies.

**Fun keeps kids playing.** Energy, games, and laughter are part of every lesson. When tennis is enjoyable, kids want more.

**Community supports development.** Players learn from each other. Parents are part of the journey. Families belong here.

**Kids take ownership.** Players choose their own goals. They decide how seriously they want to play. Tennis belongs to them.

## Our Mission

> Foundation Tennis gives kids the freedom to own their tennis journey, surrounded by a community of teammates and coaches who inspire them to grow - on and off the court.

## Partner Schools

We run after-school programs at:

- **Paringa Park Primary School** - Mondays 3:15-4pm
- **McAuley Community School** - Wednesdays 3:15-4pm

These programs introduce young players to tennis in a familiar environment with their classmates.
