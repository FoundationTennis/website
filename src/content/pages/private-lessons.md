# Private Tennis Lessons

Private lessons give your child focused, one-on-one attention from our qualified coaches. Perfect for players ready to accelerate their development.

## Who Private Lessons Are For

Private coaching works best for players who:

- Are transitioning into tournament play
- Want direct technical focus and detailed feedback
- Need to work on specific aspects of their game
- Are ready for intensive, personalised coaching

For most beginners, we recommend starting with group lessons. The social environment helps kids build confidence and enjoy the game.

## Our Coaches

### Maxim Paskalutsa - Head Coach

**$50 per 30 minutes**

Maxim brings 15 years of coaching experience and a deep understanding of player development. His sessions focus on helping players understand the "why" behind every shot.

*Note: Maxim's private lessons are limited to development players and availability is restricted.*

### Zoe Patfull-Bulmer - Assistant Head Coach

**$40 per 30 minutes**

Zoe holds her Tennis Australia Junior Development qualification. Having grown up at Foundation Tennis herself, she understands exactly what young players need.

### Sota / George - Coaches

**$30 per 30 minutes**

Quality coaching at an accessible price point. Great for players looking to supplement their group training.

## What to Expect

Each private lesson is tailored to your child's needs. Coaches assess current skills, identify areas for improvement, and create a focused plan.

Each lesson typically includes:

- Technical skill development
- Video feedback (with Maxim)
- Specific drills for problem areas
- Game-situation practice
- Clear homework for practice between lessons

## How to Book

We will discuss your child's goals and match them with the right coach.

## Combine With Group Training

Private lessons work best alongside regular group training. Groups build match experience and social skills, while privates focus on technical refinement.
