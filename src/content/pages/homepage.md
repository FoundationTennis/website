# Your Child's Tennis Journey Starts Here

At Foundation Tennis, kids discover the joy of tennis in a supportive community. Our proven coaching helps young players build skills, confidence, and friendships that last beyond the court.

## Why Parents Choose Foundation Tennis

### Growth at Every Level

Your child improves at their own pace. We celebrate progress over perfection, helping players develop as athletes and as people.

### Fun Comes First

Kids who enjoy tennis keep playing tennis. Every lesson includes games, energy, and laughter. Your child will ask to come back.

### A Real Community

Families belong here. Players support each other, parents are welcome, and relationships form that extend beyond tennis.

### Your Child Takes Charge

Kids own their tennis journey. They choose how seriously they play, set their own goals, and take charge of their development.

## Programs for Every Age and Stage

From first-time players to competitive juniors, we have a program that fits your child.

**Beginners (Ages 5-8):** Red and Orange groups use smaller courts and softer balls. Your child learns the basics through fun games and activities.

**Developing Players (Ages 8-12):** Green and Yellow groups build on fundamentals. Players develop technique, tactics, and match play skills.

**Advanced Juniors:** Development squads and competition coaching for players ready to take their game further.
