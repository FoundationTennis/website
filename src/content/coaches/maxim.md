# Maxim Paskalutsa

Maxim is the Head Coach of Foundation Tennis Development, bringing 15 years of coaching experience to players of all ages.

## Coaching Philosophy

> "I help kids understand themselves and their tennis through feel and problem-solving. When something goes right or wrong on court, we ask: why did that happen? Technical, physical, emotional, mental - it all combines to produce each result."

Maxim believes everything in tennis connects. His coaching addresses the whole player, not just their technique. He creates an environment where kids learn to think, feel, and take ownership of their game.

## Tennis Background

Maxim started playing tennis at age 6 and competed in tournaments from age 10. He currently plays at the top of Metro 1 with a 10+ UTR.

His playing experience informs his coaching. He understands the challenges players face because he has faced them himself.

## Qualifications

- Tennis Australia Junior Development Coach
- Working with Children Check
- First Aid Certificate
